# Library Management System - GUI using Java and SQL

The Library Management System is a comprehensive project developed to simplify the process of managing books and librarians in a library. It comes with an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java and utilizes a SQL database for efficient data management. The following features are included in this project:

## Features:

1.GUI-based Library Management System in Java with SQL database.
2.Features admin and librarian logins with separate dashboards.
3.Book management with options to add and update book details.
4.Librarian management to add and modify librarian records.
5.Issue and return book functionalities for librarians.
6.View available books, issued books, and librarian lists.
7.Smooth database connectivity managed through DB.java.
8.Includes SQL files for table structure and initial data.

## How to Use:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) and a suitable SQL server installed on your system.
2. Set up the database by executing the SQL files (books.sql, issuebooks.sql, librarian.sql, and test.sql) to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.
3. Compile the Java files using the Java compiler.
4. Run the Library.java file to launch the GUI-based Library Management System.
5. Use the AdminLogin.java to log in as an admin or LibrarianLogin.java for librarian access.
6. Navigate through the various forms and functionalities to manage books, librarians, and book issuance/returns effectively.
7. It is preffered to use XAMPP for running the entire project.

## Technologies Used

- Java for the frontend GUI and application logic.
- SQL for the backend database management.
- XAMPP for compiling.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Set up the database using the provided SQL scripts.
3. Configure the database connection in the Java code
4. Build and run the project.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Book Recommendations:** Use machine learning algorithms to provide personalized book recommendations based on user preferences and borrowing history.
2. **Online Payment Integration:** Enable online payment for fines or membership fees.
3. **Notifications:** Send notifications to librarians and users for important events, such as new book additions, upcoming due dates, and overdue books.
4. **Reservations and Holds:** Enable users to reserve books that are currently unavailable and notify them when the book becomes available.
